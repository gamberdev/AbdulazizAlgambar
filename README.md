Summary
"Call center managers are the backbone of any organization offering
customer service"
Without their leadership and skillets, it would be impossible to
maintain the company’s vision and goals and keep the staff
members motivated.
An accomplished manager with nearly (26) years of experience
overseeing daily operations, process improvements, and
sophisticated data analysis to achieve customer service excellence
in high-volume call centers.
My expertise lies in successfully enhancing customer response
strategies, innovating new processes, and managing overall
customer service functionality to maximize loyalty, productivity, and
growth to surpass expectations. 
Throughout my career, I have developed and led staff training
programs, supervised workforce and performance analysis, and
directed strategic projects and initiatives to accelerate revenue
growth while slashing costs. 
Additionally, my success in coaching and leading customer-centric
teams positions me to make a significant impact on any organization.
I'm very proud to have the achievement as part of Top5 project to
reach with Saudia airlines to be awarded as five-star global airlines
in 2021 by APEX.
